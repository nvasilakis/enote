# ![enote icon](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~nvas/enote-64.png)  enoté

The sexiest note-taking and reminder-setup application for Linux:)

Take notes, schedule tasks and setup reminders. Monitor progress, get
notifications and cross-out when you're done. Synchronize with your
online services, take them on your phone or host everything  on the
cloud.  _And do all of these with style!_
